Notes:
	os.stat is used to determine owner, permissions and mTime
	however, there is probably a better way to do that as ll 
	returns info on files/dirs that are not accessible otherwise
	but os.stat does not. 



Permissions:
	Test directories and files:
		with full permissions
		Read and Execute permissions
		Read permissions
		
Patterns:
	patterns with no qoutes (Raw strings)
	patterns in qoutes interpret special chars


Recursive Tests:
	On recursive tests, test with 3 levels of recursion
	

Postive Tests:
./mini-ls
./mini-ls .
./mini-ls ./

./mini-ls -r
./mini-ls -r .
./mini-ls -r ./

./mini-ls -r [DIR]
./mini-ls [DIR] -r

./mini-ls -r [FILE]
./mini-ls [FILE] -r

./mini-ls [DIR, FILE]
./mini-ls -r [DIR, FILE]
./mini-ls [DIR, FILE] -r


			
Negative:
./mini-ls {} 
./mini-ls -q
./mini-ls r
